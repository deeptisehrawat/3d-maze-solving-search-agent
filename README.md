# 3d-maze-solving-search-agent
▪ Developed a sophisticated and intelligent search agent using AI search techniques such as Breadth-First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A-Star Search Algorithms to solve complex 3D mazes. ▪ The agent navigates through the maze configuration and finds the optimal shortest path from the entrance to exit, using a list of actions available along the way. ▪ Python, BFS, UCS, A-star Search Algorithms
